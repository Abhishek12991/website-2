- abstract: "<p>What is the mission of the museum? Why are there museums? What is\
    \ the purpose of museums? What is he trying to achieve? What are their goals?\
    \ There is nothing more important than a mission in determining its priorities\
    \ and general direction for the museum. The answers to these questions are in\
    \ the values \u200B\u200Bof the museum. Add mission and values, promote the project\
    \ and define the vision of the museum. In this episode, the author claims that\
    \ mission, values \u200B\u200Band vision captured the \u201Ccore\u201D of the\
    \ museum. Working with examples from his professional experience as a director\
    \ at the Tyne and Wear museums and the National Museums in Liverpool, England,\
    \ Fleming promotes organizational change, interacts better with the masses, improves\
    \ museum services and is more sustainable. There are many external and internal\
    \ problems, and the ever-growing social changes, mission, values \u200B\u200B\
    and vision serve as a guide and support for the museum even in the most difficult\
    \ times. Social changes in our lives pose new challenges for museums. The fact\
    \ that these cultural institutions in Azerbaijan meet the requirements of historical\
    \ conditions testifies to its integration into the world museum system. If we\
    \ want to clarify the history of museum work in Azerbaijan, we can see the historical\
    \ traditions of this area in our country. Historical evidence shows that the collection\
    \ of art that is the forerunner of modern museums and the traditions of the collection\
    \ are ancient. BC It is well known that in the first centuries, as well as in\
    \ the ruling palaces, temples and churches of Atropatena and Albania, valuable\
    \ objects, rare artifacts, rich books and manuscripts of secular and religious\
    \ content were preserved. Especially during the rule of the Safavids, interest\
    \ in the traditions of the collection and the development of the museum, which\
    \ was considered the forerunner of modern museums, became even stronger.\n</p>"

    order to demonstrate as the change in our perception of space and in the structure
    of time, mainly due to the emergence of notions as dynamism, synchronism, connection

    both the form of arts and its structures, in this sense undermined at the core
    the basis of historical European culture. Industrialization and technology have
    thus rewritten our society and caused an impressive array of structural changes.
    In this sense, the new technological era, started in the 1920s but implemented
    above all in the 1990s thank to the spread of the Web and its platforms, has proved
    to be a huge opportunity for teaching and learning in which historical-comparative

    \ English Faculty at Cambridge University to investigate possibilities for the\
    \ interoperability of annotated audio resources with other kinds of files, such\
    \ as images, text and video. The event brought together researchers, librarians\
    \ and software developers to explore solutions through real-life case studies,\
    \ focused on IIIF as an enabling technology. We propose to present our reflections\
    \ and conclusions from this meeting, and some possible ways forward based on our\
    \ existing case studies.</p><p>While IIIF now has the potential to surface audio\
    \ and video files in a similar way to image files, a consistent means or tool\
    \ to handle the integration of e.g. audio files and text files is still a significant\
    \ gap in terms of outputting these resources. The meeting discussed case studies\
    \ involving text, audio and video files, and how we might want them to be presented\
    \ to the web in an integrated and intuitive manner. We also discussed what tools\
    \ or technologies might be developed to create these integrated online experiences.\
    \ The case studies were:</p><p>\u2022\tSounding Tennyson \u2013 Because Alfred\
    \ Lord Tennyson felt that the auditory experience of his poems was crucial to\
    \ communicating meaning, this case study presents recordings of Tennyson\u2019\
    s wife\u2019s musical settings of the poem \u201CBreak, Break, Break,\u201D images\
    \ of the musical scores that move in time to the music, and related commentary.\
    \ This project \u2013 the first to use sound with IIIF \u2013 has provided the\
    \ origin for multiple fixtures in the A/V group. We now aim to update the current\
    \ display to a newly built application standard.</p><p>\u2022\tSpokenWeb \u2013\
    \ This use case introduces a scenario for large-scale, collaborative projects\
    \ like the SpokenWeb research partnership in which multiple users are creating\
    \ audio annotations for collections of documentary literary recordings held at\
    \ university library and archives across Canada. The goal is to investigate the\
    \ features that would best facilitate scholarly engagement with recorded poetry\
    \ recitation and performance across multiple, diverse audio collections. In this\
    \ scenario, participants at Canadian partner institutions will annotate locally-held\
    \ AV files from pre-determined relational sets, across different collections and\
    \ then display the results of such comparative annotations.</p><p>\u2022\tQur\u02BC\
    \u0101nic manuscripts \u2013 Cambridge University Library holds an internationally\
    \ important set of early Qur\u02BC\u0101ns. The recitation of the Qur\u02BC\u0101\
    nic text is central to Islam. This case study proposes to integrate three resources\
    \ \u2013 high resolution images of the manuscripts, transcriptions of the text\
    \ and audio recordings of recitations both to investigate the relation of text\
    \ to performance, and to produce a compelling and interactive online experience\

- abstract: '<p>Access to high quality well-documented images is key to modern research,
    dissemination of cultural knowledge and engagement with heritage collections and
    sites. The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) provides a flexible,
    collaborative approach to providing reliable access to such research images and
    in additional to the core IIIF APIs a range of open source IIIF image servers
    and viewers are available to build future imaged based research resources. However,
    though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be
    complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. In addition,
    a better understanding of how to deploy IIIF to combine virtual collections across
    institutions and how to support more diverse audiences is needed. </p><p>In February
    2020 a new research project, "Practical applications of IIIF as a building block
    towards a digital National Collection", funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research
    Council (AHRC), began which aims to highlight and demonstrate opportunities and
    benefits the IIIF standard offers to a wide audience of institutions and researchers.
    It will examine and develop its potential to virtually connect collections from
    different organisations, allowing users to experience and interact with images
    of collections and related material, both for research and public presentations.
    </p><p>It will explore efficient methods of using the IIIF standard as we develop
    more collaborative online resources and, in collaboration with a series of other
    AHRC funded projects, will start to construct the foundations of a virtual National
    Collection. Images will underpin nearly all forms of engagement with and management
    of a digital ''National Collection'', therefore lowering the barriers for participation
    in the use of IIIF will facilitate a broad spectrum of projects including collections
    research, conservation, collections management and audience engagement. </p><p>This
    project will help to define and better understand more robust use cases of IIIF,
    for institutions able to present IIIF resources and also for researchers and potentially
    members of the public who want to re-use and exploit these resources to carry
    out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. At the
    same time we intend to document/list existing IIIF systems and tools, and to demonstrate
    how they can be used, along with identifying what additional tools, services or
    training opportunities are available and exploring what new ideas need to be developed
    to help maximise the potential of IIIF resources. This will be achieved through
    a series of targeted workshops and surveys.</p><p>A series of pilot demonstrators
    are planned to provide tangible outcomes that show in a concrete way what can
    be achieved. An objective from their construction will be greater understanding
    of potential applications and any future development needs, exploring this in
    a deeper way than possible in the workshops. This process will involve both technical
    and non-technical researchers in building resources collaboratively to increase
    mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p><p>This presentation
    will outline the key aspects of this new project, helping to foster discussion
    and highlight the opportunities of the planned workshops.

- abstract: "<p>Poza\u0144 Supercomputing and Networking Center, as an ICT-focused\
    \ R&D centre, has been involved in development of software technology for cultural\
    \ heritage and digital humanities domains for almost two decades now. Our flagship\
    \ toolset DInGO (\"Digitise and Go\") is used by hundreds of institutions in Poland\
    \ and abroad. Altogether we serve more that 140 deployments of digital GLAMs,\
    \ of which more than a dozen uses professional digitization pipelines and archiving\
    \ solutions from the DInGO toolset. In recent years we have introduced IIIF technology\
    \ in several projects and tools, so that digital objects with high quality images\
    \ can be easily accessed and used by the end users. We used in production IIP\
    \ Image Server and Cantaloupe as well as OpenSeadragon and UniversalViewer. In\
    \ order to deliver data via IIIF we have implemented various conversion routines\
    \ to provide content in appropriate format. In our presentation we would like\
    \ to present our approaches to production-level use of IIIF technology and related\
    \ experiences of:\n- Data Exchange Infrastructure that has been developed in EnrichEuropeana\
    \ project, \n- Virtual Transcription Laboratory being implemented in cooperation\
    \ with University of Wroc\u0142aw, \n- dLibra system (off-the-shelf solution)\
    \ with more than 140 deployments in Poland and abroad.</p><p>EnrichEuropeana aims\
    \ to encourage various communities to improve metadata quality of objects exposed\
    \ mainly in Europeana Collections via transcription. Many of the digital objects\
    \ from cultural heritage contain scans of handwritten documents or they are graphic-based\
    \ objects with unstructured textual information. Transcription of such scans requires\
    \ working with the images in high zoom, therefore IIIF was selected as an image\
    \ delivery technology. The solution uses IIIF available at the original locations\
    \ or prepared internally (conversion routines) from other data formats (e.g. PDFs)\
    \ and exposed using IIP Image Server. The streams are used by the OpenSeadragon\
    \ viewer in the Transcribathon Platform. This viewer was chosen for its performance\
    \ and low effort needed for customization. </p><p>Another approach is being developed\
    \ with Wroc\u0142aw University Library (WUL) to support digital repositories in\
    \ enhancing their content via transcription tool with built in character recognition,\
    \ IIIF-based streams and automated OCR training routines. The main idea behind\
    \ this project is to fully integrate digital repository with the transcription\
    \ toolset, so that it is possible to enhance digital assets with full-text (line-level\
    \ regions). This approach is to stimulate cooperation between researchers and\
    \ content providers - WUL will provide digital content that can be used in the\
    \ research practices, while the researchers will work with the content and create/enhance\
    \ its full-text. The important part is that the full-text will be fed back to\
    \ the original repository as an alternative representation of the digital resource.\
    \ </p><p>PSNC has also implemented IIIF technology into dLibra system, which is\
    \ a tool serving hundreds of institutions, and helping them to publish their digital\
    \ resources online. In the newest 6th generation of the system we have implemented\
    \ Cantaloupe IIIF server and Universal Viewer. The viewer has been selected because\
    \ it is not only used for IIIF streams, but also for other types of resources\
    \ such as legacy image galleries.\n</p>"

- abstract: <p>As a small liberal arts institution with special and distinctive collections,  our
    goal was to provide a proof of concept for  IIIF implementation that did not require
    an abundance of technical infrastructure or staff support.  By blending this aim
    with a teaching and research case study, we hope to emphasize the role an image
    specification such as IIIF can play in providing a critical framework for manuscript
    study.  </p><p>As part of a semester-long History of Islamic Art and Architecture
    course, students are collectively studying a Persian manuscript believed to be
    a Shanama (The Persian Book of Kings).  This text, possibly Mughal in origin,  dates
    to the seventeenth or eighteenth century.  In studying the manuscript, students
    research various components of the object such as material, design, iconography,
    the role of the art market, as well as the preservation considerations of the
    digital surrogates.  Our aim was to use IIIF to enhance teaching and research
    while piloting a small-scale implementation of our own IIIF image server with
    the manuscript as its test case.  This is a particularly apt example because the
    manuscript bears evidence of dealer intervention, making it well-positioned for
    the annotation and digital reconstitution capabilities afford by IIIF.  By calling
    out these instances of manipulation,  there is the opportunity to digitally re-orient
    the page images within a virtual exhibit, providing additional context to the
    adaptations made to the original manuscript for an early 20th century art market.  </p><p>In
    using IIIF to enable this research project,  we have positioned the resources
    for expanded modes of scholarship and interoperability.   This implementation
    was achieved by spinning up a Digital Ocean droplet and with Cantaloupe, a Java-based
    image server.  Our aim was to demonstrate using IIIF and Cantaloupe as a viable
    small-scale approach to making our digitized special collections actionable, as
    well as leveraging the functionally of IIIF in conjunction with various digital
    presentation methods, platforms, and digital literacy goals.  </p><p></p>

    \ Services,\u201D describes the means for encoding or referencing spatial data\
    \ via GeoJSON values or an external GeoJSON data source. Last updated in 2017,\
    \ the service specification describes its purpose as enabling \u201Cthe ability\
    \ to associate a geographical place with a resource.\u201D </p><p>The major constraint\
    \ of the service specification is the requirement of GeoJSON (or, as recommended,\
    \ geoJSON-LD) representations of geospatial data, suggesting that ease of implementation\
    \ in existing IIIF viewers has been a guiding priority, while also limiting the\
    \ kinds of spatial data and services with which IIIF resources can easily interface.\
    \ IIIF guidelines or a \u201Ccookbook\u201D for implementation of GeoJSON services\
    \ have not emerged, though additional use cases have been identified that seek\
    \ to exploit linkages with more diverse forms of spatial data, or other common\
    \ geographic information services--particularly in the IIIF Maps Community Group.</p><p>UCD\
    \ Digital Library (https://digital.ucd.ie), a repository of cultural heritage\
    \ and research data hosted by the Library of University College Dublin (UCD),\
    \ uses the GeoJSON service specification to enrich its representations of cultural\

    \ as well as sound and video recordings that reference geographic places; images\
    \ of historical maps, many of which have been georeferenced; GIS representations\
    \ of Irish geopolitical boundaries and the built environment; and research data\
    \ documenting the Irish built environment, including both georectified images\

    \ box to represent an area of interest. Most cases, however, have more complex\
    \ requirements in order to appropriately contextualise a digital object--the boundary\
    \ of a place, or the geographic footprint of a built structure. In such cases\
    \ references to an external GIS resource are encoded. Another way by which external\
    \ services are exploited involves spatial queries, driven by spatial references\
    \ in metadata, which enable the UCD Digital Library web interface to identify\

    \ part of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA)\
    \ project for correcting the output of optical music recognition (OMR) workflows.\
    \ The goal of an OMR workflow is to generate digital encodings from high-quality\
    \ music score images so that music can be programmatically searched and analyzed.\
    \ Our OMR workflows generate encodings that use the Music Encoding Initiative\
    \ (MEI) format. Using the MEI files, Neon renders a graphical representation of\
    \ the encodings layered on top of the source images to aid users in identifying\
    \ and correcting errors introduced in the automatic OMR process. </p><p>The original\
    \ Neon handled one page at a time, but the current version is capable of displaying\
    \ an entire manuscript using Diva.js, a IIIF-compliant document viewer. A significant\
    \ challenge is introduced when handling multiple pages simultaneously since there\
    \ is no explicit mapping between the canvas elements representing pages in a IIIF\
    \ manifest and the MEI documents encoding the information of those pages. As manuscripts\
    \ can have hundreds and even thousands of pages, any acceptable solution must\
    \ be scalable. We designed a separate metadata file to encode these mappings that\
    \ avoids pre-processing of MEI documents. This supports mapping each page in manuscripts\
    \ to many encodings\u2014possibly the result of different human editors or trying\
    \ different OMR workflows.</p><p>The metadata file, formatted as JSON-LD, contains\
    \ all the information necessary to load a manuscript and its MEI files for visualization\
    \ or editing using Neon. A field of the file contains the IRI to the IIIF manifest\
    \ for the document. This manifest is loaded for use by Diva.js and to get a list\
    \ of canvases. Another field contains an array of annotations using the W3C Web\
    \ Annotation Data Model. Using IRIs, canvases are associated to their respective\
    \ MEI documents. These annotations are loaded into Neon and indexed by canvas\
    \ IRI. When Neon views a page, the MEI file can be looked up, loaded, and rendered\
    \ as needed. The use of a separate metadata file does not require an authority\
    \ to decide which annotations should be included. Additionally, as MEI files are\
    \ only represented as IRIs, editors are not required to have access to a server\
    \ to host these files. Instead, MEI files may be encoded as data URIs within the\
    \ metadata file itself, permitting easier collaboration at stages where the contents\
    \ of MEI files may change frequently.</p><p>By using IIIF, Neon is now capable\
    \ of handling manuscripts rather than single pages. Information from IIIF manifests\
    \ is used to create a metadata file that links canvases\u2014representing pages\u2014\
    and MEI files encoding the musical contents of these pages. The use of this metadata\
    \ file provides a flexible framework for collaboration in the context of correcting\
    \ an OMR workflow. We expect that with this set of technologies in place, the\
    \ SIMSSA project is providing the first music editor for square notation, allowing\
    \ scholars, performers, and the general audience to enjoy music that before was\
    \ only available in libraries, churches, and museums.\n</p>"

- abstract: '<p>Through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Johns Hopkins
    and Tufts University are working with a group of partners to develop a framework
    for annotation interoperability. The overarching goal of this grant is a demonstration
    of making use of annotations created in one application for one purpose in another
    application for another purpose using web-based standards, protocols, and associated
    APIs. Through an initial planning workshop, we developed relevant ideas and approaches
    in consultation with application teams from Hypothes.is, T-Pen, Digital Mappa,
    Pelagios Commons, and with Rob Sanderson, Semantic Architect at the Getty Institute
    and member of the W3C Web Annotation working group. The Johns Hopkins team has
    modeled sample content from the Digital Library of Medieval Manuscripts and the
    Tufts team has modeled sample content from the Perseus Digital Library in a manner
    that both teams can display content within separate reading environments. The
    Johns Hopkins team is using IIIF and Mirador for displaying images and associated
    text. The Tufts team is incorporating IIIF support into the Scaife Digital Library
    Viewer and adding a W3C Web Annotation endpoint to share annotations with other
    reading environments.This presentation will describe the proposed approach and
    demonstrate our initial results, including a description of both research and
    teaching use cases. </p><p>

- abstract: '<p>The MIT Museum is preparing to move to a new building in the year
    2022. As part of this radical transformation, it will be further improving its
    content infrastructure, including evolving its digital asset practice. The Museum
    currently maintains over 20 Terabytes of media files related to its collection.
    It is rapidly adding new assets to its collection (thousands of new images a week)
    as it prepares for its transition to a new space.  With limited staff and resources,
    the Museum needed to transform its mostly ad-hoc digitization practice to more
    production-ready and scalable systems and workflows.  </p><p>One of the first
    steps for the Museum was to establish a media audit to unpack and enumerate over
    20 years of legacy systems and storage. The Museum implemented workflow to ingest
    full resolution images into cloud storage, including minimal digital preservation
    steps.  From there, images are processed through an automated sequence to prepare
    for IIIF services.</p><p>Building on top of a commercial content delivery network
    (Cloudinary), the Museum developed an open-source, serverless (AWS Lambda)  image
    server. This system drives assets for its internal collections management system,
    publicly accessible online collections portal, and in-gallery collections browsing
    experiences.  This project represents a turn-key, cost-effective solution that
    scales from small to extensive collections while maintaining Level 2 compliance
    with the IIIF Image API Specification.</p><p>This talk describes the technical
    and Museum workflow efforts required to establish a sustainable digitization pipeline
    from the photography lab to a IIIF-powered online and onsite collections experience.  It
    will describe the system architecture for its IIIF server and introduce the community
    to this resource while highlighting areas for further investigation.

    is an iterative process and repositories should be able to grow organically by
    accommodating and allowing local ways, changing needs and enforcing institutional

    that happen Archipelago allows a very flexible abstraction between local metadata,

    via stable and predictable schemas and ontologies. This strategy and the fact
    that all source-raw metadata is managed as JSON allowed us to include IIIF everywhere,
    as core, as output, API and media exposure mechanism driven by a UI facing templating
    system. We want to share our approach and experience doing this designing this

- abstract: '<p>Now that Presentation 3 and Web Annotation APIs are stable and being
    used in practice, there are new opportunities for data to pass the LOUD test.
    Ambiguous or heavily munged data is becoming more easily filtered, reanalyzed,
    and amended, even as the data artifacts come from increasingly remote and unrelated
    repositories. New projects are being considered where users can interact with
    curated collections and respond to resources in a persistent and non-destructive
    way. The logistic challenges of obtaining and republishing primary resources has
    been replaced with the challenges of finding meaningful moments in heaps of data
    that are unaware of each other and offering connections between them publicly
    and reliably.  This often results in asserting something new wanting to present
    the combined result. While the purpose has remained much the same as traditional
    scholarship, the input and output activities are as varied as migrating personal
    transportation from a horse to an automobile.</p><p>Two years ago, OngCDH offered
    the public alpha of the RERUM annotation ecosystem to the community. In the time
    since, we have focused on creating interfaces and components that are approachable
    for different levels of users including designers, developers, and researchers.
    After a quick tour of the available tools that encourage standards-compliant and
    nondestructive annotation of distributed resources (even non-digitized ones),
    we will focus on two recent developments that have peaked the imagination of researchers
    in Digital Humanities.</p><p>The first is a framework which offers meaningful
    interactions with maps in IIIF. A great challenge lies in bringing together coordinate
    data artifacts that may have been made under different standards or grid systems
    and targeting viewers to render that information in a useful and consistent manner.  IIIF
    + Maps aims to bring the same standards of interoperable images to interoperable
    maps. There is a constant din from researchers to realize and render coordinate
    data.  Users should be able to access a IIIF collection of digitized map resources
    and be able to consume the annotations that exist on them together, even if annotations
    are coming from third party data sets. By utilizing the Web Annotation standard,
    new annotations made within a IIIF viewer may even be redistributed back to viewers
    focused only on GIS visualizations and renderings.</p><p>The second tool is an
    application for building and describing collections. The focus here is on thematic
    or curated collections that cross repositories, especially those that defy categorization
    or require the creation of abstract entities (e.g., tracking enslaved people through
    business documents, legal filings, and correspondence or generating unifying themes
    across the folk art of different cultures). This collection management tool aims
    to land somewhere between the friendly and ubiquitous Omeka (omeka.com) application
    and the carefully curated and crafted cultural heritage galleries that have come
    out of the Digirati (cultural-heritage.digirati.com) pipeline.</p><p>These applications
    will not be presented in their final state, but with the context of their role
    in the Rerum ecosystem and several cases that have proved out the functioning
    prototypes, including some fully funded projects still in progress.

- abstract: '<p>Some challenges in digital resources exist because the materials are
    only a sporadic representation of the corpus and lack of funding and standards
    prevent the careful attention and prescience required. Other challenges are born
    from aging standards and established digitization and collection practices that
    may be too numerous or dissimilar to easily reconcile. An attempt to combine IIIF
    and maps confronts both. Maps are a challenge to photograph and represent consistently
    and their history, even if digital, includes many different purposes that projected
    the resource itself into inconsistent encoding schemata. Bryan Haberberger at
    OngCDH has been working with the IIIF+Maps interest group to establish some expectations
    for the practical intersection between GIS, Web Annotation, and IIIF. He will
    demonstrate the pitfalls to avoid and reveal what is possible with the use of
    standards and tools that have already existed in the IIIF sphere for years. Specifically,
    he will talk about how he was able to generate a map rendering that loads coordinate
    information targeting different data artifacts across systems and combines the
    information into a standard format and navigable dynamic rendering in a compact

- abstract: "<p>For many collecting institutions, collection development was first\
    \ typified by physical artefacts. These institutions saw their policies expand\
    \ with the onset of digital surrogates being created from their physical counterparts,\
    \ as well as the onset of born-digital artefacts for which no physical counterpart\
    \ exists. \n \nIncreasingly, collecting institutions are being confronted by challenges\
    \ posed by hybrid acquisitions. One example is rich archival collections comprised\
    \ of physical and digital artefacts that challenge preservationists to preserve\
    \ these objects for the long term as well as to make them accessible and discoverable\
    \ to audiences. A further challenge is found in how these objects will relate\
    \ to one another in both digital and physical spaces. </p><p>This paper examines\
    \ the emergence of a new use case for IIIF objects, namely the interaction between\
    \ the physical manuscript and its digital counterpart outside of the scope of\
    \ traditional IIIF hierarchies. It also queries the ways in which IIIF-compliant\
    \ metadata can be used to establish or define the relationships between both digital\
    \ and physical objects both in a specific use case and more broadly.  \n \nThough\
    \ we envision the aim of making objects accessible and discoverable as manifested\
    \ in the IIIF framework and this community as a new phenomenon, 500 years ago\
    \ Elizabethan humanists shared these concerns, and sought to make data accessible\
    \ and available through manuscript copies and early printed editions. \n \nThis\
    \ paper uses Asser\u2019s Life of Alfred as a case study: originally preserved\
    \ in the British Museum, Cotton MS Otho A.xii is a manuscript which was entirely\
    \ destroyed by a fire in 1731. However, prior to its destruction, the text was\
    \ preserved at the behest of Matthew Parker in the 1570s, who had insisted that\
    \ the text be copied, long-hand into the item now known as CCCC MS 100, the singular\
    \ surviving witness to the lost object.  The text of MS 100 was then combined\
    \ with other accounts and printed in 1574. In 2006, the manuscript was digitised\
    \ as part of The Parker Library on the Web project. In 2020, the images were printed,\
    \ bound, and used as a surrogate for the codex at the Vale and Downland Museum,\
    \ resulting in three copies. </p><p>Created for educational purposes, this new\
    \ physical object will facilitate audience engagement in a different way than\
    \ from what the digital version can provide--and one that harkens back to its\
    \ original format. The IIIF community often refers to digital surrogates as children\
    \ of their physical objects. This begs the question: would this new physical copy\
    \ be a grandchild of MS 100, or is it, to extend the metaphor, starting its own\
    \ family tree? </p><p></p>"

- abstract: "<p>This presentation introduces the features and use cases of Readux,\
    \ a platform for reading and annotating digitized texts. Developed by Emory University's\
    \ Center for Digital Scholarship with Brumfield Labs, Readux is a tool for research,\
    \ teaching and publishing. Readux pairs a book's high resolution page images with\
    \ its textual content, drawing on optical character recognition to transparently\
    \ overlay a page's text on its image via Web Annotations using a customized version\
    \ of the Mirador viewer. Scholars can then annotate both the image and the OCR\
    \ text simultaneously, using Web Annotations to target the IIIF image resource\
    \ and the OCR layer. Originally built atop Emory\u2019s repository, Readux has\
    \ been refactored to use IIIF so that it can leverage image resources from a much\
    \ broader community of institutions and selectively publish Readux material for\
    \ reuse via IIIF. Readux offers a rich browsing interface for digitized works,\
    \ permits multimedia annotation of text and image and supports export of interactive\
    \ digital editions pairing a digitized work's pages with a user's annotations.\
    \ Its export functionality adopts philosophies of minimal computing that have\
    \ led to a new focus on static sites as flexible and sustainable ways of publishing\
    \ research to the web. Readux exports to a static site by reading the IIIF manifest\
    \ & Web Annotations and publishing via Jekyll. Building reading, annotating, and\
    \ publishing positions Readux to support both classroom exploration of texts and\
    \ the production of collaborative critical editions. In addition to these front-end\
    \ use cases, Readux is a powerful tool for content curators who want to easily\
    \ set up their own thematic collections. Its content management system and administrative\
    \ interfaces provide a form-based approach to generate manifests and build IIIF\
    \ compliant collections. As an open-source project in its first release, the Readux\
    \ team is working to serve scholarly communities in reaping the benefits of IIIF.\
    \ An early adopter of the platform is the Sounding Spirit initiative, an NEH-funded\
    \ digital library and collection of scholarly editions that seeks to enhance access\
    \ to sacred vernacular American music books. In sum, Readux supports an unprecedented\
    \ level of engagement with the visual and textual content of digitized texts.</p><p></p>"

- abstract: "<p>The Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC, https://www.tbrc.org/)\
    \ is a secular nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts dedicated\
    \ to seeking out, preserving, documenting, and disseminating Buddhist literature.\
    \ BDRC has been developing a new platform (in beta-stage) called BUDA based on\
    \ a Linked Open Data backend. The new platform provides access to its 17 million\
    \ images in IIIF, representing around 50 thousand published works and manuscripts.</p><p>In\
    \ this talk we present the BUDA Embedded Reader, a pilot project launched by BDRC\
    \ at the end of 2019, whose goal is to allow traditional Buddhist institutions\
    \ (such as academies, monastic libraries, religious publishing houses, etc.) in\
    \ Asia to include an image reader (which we refer to as an \"Embedded Reader\"\
    \ or ER) on their website. The ER is an instance of Mirador that uses the BUDA\
    \ IIIF presentation and image APIs; and can be integrated on any website very\
    \ easily to allow monasteries and other organizations to provide a no-cost web\
    \ presence providing access to digital collections that they curate entirely at\
    \ their own discretion, and with a reasonable guarantee that the images will remain\
    \ online for the foreseeable future.\_</p><p>Use cases</p><p>The ER is integrated\
    \ into websites for different purposes:\n    \u2022 Buddhist academies may use\
    \ it to provide online electronic versions of the traditional texts that are studied\
    \ in the traditional curriculum\n    \u2022 Libraries may use it to provide online\
    \ access to some highlight in their collection\n    \u2022 Monasteries may use\
    \ it to highlight works that have been written by the abbots and scholars of the\
    \ monastery in the past\n    \u2022 Publishing houses may use it to publish a\
    \ part of their collection online</p><p>Workflow</p><p>The project uses the following\
    \ workflow:\n    1. partner institutions provide us with a list of ERs that they\
    \ want on their website; and for each ER an outline of the works that they want\
    \ to see in it (which can contain multiple levels of hierarchy)\n    2. this data\
    \ is gathered in a csv file on a git repository, synchronized daily with our database\n\
    \    3. the synchronization results in the generation of new \"Virtual Works\"\
    \ in our database, and their corresponding IIIF collections\n    4. these new\
    \ works are finally communicated to partner institutions, that use them to configure\
    \ their ER\_\nThe ER is itself a very simple iframe, it has no dependencies and\
    \ is easily integrated. This workflow was carefully designed requiring only minimal\
    \ technical skills to facilitate maximum access to our ER.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The\
    \ BUDA ER will allow BDRC to fulfill its mission of improving access to traditional\
    \ materials; and will answer the demand of traditional institutions to highlight\
    \ some of their works without the need of the high-level skills that are necessary\
    \ to set up and maintain a full IIIF server. Proactively sharing images and making\
    \ them accessible to the culture that created them is a good fulfillment of IIIF\
    \ interoperability mission; and we hope BUDA ER can inspire more libraries and\
    \ museums with online IIIF collections to make their materials accessible even\
    \ more widely!</p><p></p>"

    existing manifests to provide enhanced access to IIIF content. These enhancements
    include adding structural metadata such as a table of contents, extracting sub-objects
    as independent entities using annotations, and presenting the content in a different
    application setting for improved navigability (in this case using Wax). These
    uses obviously depend on the licensing of the original content, and must be implemented
    in such a way as to inform the user about the ownership of the content and responsibility
    for its presentation. Where the interests of the content owner and the content
    borrower align, this approach allows collaborative enrichment of the user experience.
    Through use of IIIF''s static implementation it also allows for a low-computing
    approach which can help to bridge the sustainability gap between small and informal
    projects, such as student work, and the large-scale and necessarily less flexible
    work of library-developed repositories.

- abstract: "<p>The IIIF Curation Platform (ICP) has started in 2016, and since then\
    \ we have released several specifications and software components to support user-driven\
    \ image sharing [1,2]. This presentation introduces our recent developments on\
    \ application-driven extensions, namely old maps, historical OCR and analytics\
    \ of curations. We utilize interoperability as a design choice, while addressing\
    \ the needs of application domains and the requirements of an image-based research\
    \ infrastructure. Our basic principle is a good balance between generality and\
    \ usability; when the extension is useful in multiple domains, we extend our specification\
    \ (e.g. Curation API [3]) and tools (e.g. IIIF Curation Viewer [4]), but when\
    \ the extension is useful in a limited domain, we develop a profile of the specification\
    \ that might be used by a limited number of new tools.</p><p>The first application\
    \ is old maps. We released \u201CEdo Maps Beta\u201D [5] in November 2019 for\
    \ the historical GIS research of the city of Edo (currently known as Tokyo) based\
    \ on place names in old maps. Our strategy is to locate place names on the canvas\
    \ coordinates of old maps (Edo Kiriezu), and later georeference the canvas coordinates\
    \ to geographic coordinates using non-linear mapping. To take advantage of the\
    \ canvas coordinates, we developed the \u201Cannotation view mode\u201D in IIIF\
    \ Curation Viewer so that the style of markers for each annotation can be configured.\
    \ For old maps, we choose  \u201Cmap markers\u201D so that old maps can be used\
    \ in the same manner with web-based maps before georeferencing and without distortion.</p><p>The\
    \ second application is historical OCR. We developed KuroNet [6] for the recognition\
    \ of Japanese cursive script using deep learning. KuroNet is inspired by object\
    \ detection methods, and it is more robust than traditional OCR against variations\
    \ of the text layout. KuroNet then became a Web service in November 2019 to allow\
    \ users apply KuroNet OCR to any IIIF-compliant image by implementing it as an\
    \ external service from IIIF Curation Viewer. The result of OCR is also shown\
    \ in IIIF Curation Viewer using the \u201Cannotation view mode\u201D to display\
    \ \u201Ccharacter markers\u201D on the location of characters so that users can\
    \ read characters directly in IIIF Curation Viewer. </p><p>We are also developing\
    \ KuroNet Text Editor for the post-editing of OCR results. Referring to text granularity\
    \ levels in the IIIF Text Granularity Technical Specification, KuroNet Text Editor\
    \ is used for adding layout information to the OCRed document, such as connecting\
    \ characters (glyphs) to create a line, and connecting lines to create a block.\
    \ </p><p>The third application is the analytics of curations. We developed Curation\
    \ Tracer to offer \u201Ccitation analysis\u201D for curations. A curation contains\
    \ links to canvases, and Curation Tracer inverts links from canvas to curation\
    \ so that content providers can analyze the usage of their assets in the collection\
    \ of curations.  Curation Tracer aggregates curation data from IIIF Change Discovery\
    \ API endpoints [7] to ensure interoperability within IIIF infrastructure. </p><p>[1]\

    \ For over 15 years, it has brought together many cultural institutions in currently\
    \ 17 countries as part of a single digitization community, focusing equally on\
    \ the coordination of both simple and complex workflows for digitization projects\
    \ (Goobi workflow) and on the publication of the digitized results of those projects\
    \ (Goobi viewer). Alongside standardized interfaces such as OAI-PMH and SRU, IIIF\
    \ plays a crucial role in ensuring interoperability between published digital\
    \ collections and different external data consumers. That\u2019s why Goobi supports\
    \ the IIIF community by providing as many IIIF APIs as possible. \nCurrently Goobi\
    \ provides support for the IIIF Image API 2.1, IIIF Presentation API 2.1, IIIF\
    \ Content Search API 1.0  and IIIF Change Discovery API in draft status. Additionally,\
    \ Goobi supports Web Annotations und Open Annotations to provide its crowdsourcing\
    \ data as well.</p><p>Technical requirements\nTo participate in this workshop,\
    \ you will need your own computer in order to be able to follow all steps. Ideally,\
    \ participants should have administrative rights on the computers so that they\
    \ can install software on them if necessary. There are no restrictions for the\

- abstract: <p>Not every institution has its own pool of developers who can develop
    support for the various IIIF APIs to make digital objects available. Often smaller
    institutions have very few staff to carry out a complete digitization project
    and to operate it permanently. Accordingly, questions about technical requirements,
    the standard to be chosen for metadata or the interfaces to be supported pose
    enormous challenges. </p><p>Within the Goobi community, a simple and pragmatic
    way of solving such problems has been found for this scenario. With a very clear
    input mask and just a few clicks, images can be provided with valid metadata and
    thus be provided with support for the IIIF Image API, IIIF Presentation API, IIIF
    Search API and IIIF ContentDiscovery API. </p><p>This lecture is designed as a
    live presentation. All tools used are available for free download under an open
    source license and are in productive use at numerous cultural institutions.</p><p></p>

- abstract: "<p>In this presentation, we show the first AI-related results obtained\
    \ within the framework of the MNEMOMED project using IIIF images. \nThe essential\
    \ paradigm of MNEMOMED is the idea of the Mediterranean Sea as an agent of cultural\
    \ history (Abulafia 2011). Started in 2019, the project wishes to reconceive the\
    \ history of music in the Mediterranean world from the fifth to the fifteenth\
    \ century by gathering and analyzing evidence for \u201Cunwritten\u201D aspects\
    \ of music that are not represented in musical notation. A transversal approach\
    \ to these aspects of medieval music around the Mediterranean will reveal shared\
    \ practices that transcend modern geographic, religious, and political boundaries.\
    \ Since the early 2010s, the massive digitization of medieval manuscripts in Arabic,\
    \ Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, now available with IIIF, enable us to assemble a significant\
    \ corpus of images and texts related to music, using powerful tools to extract\
    \ relevant results from databases and image corpora. As of 2019, individual projects\
    \ have emerged on the use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques using\
    \ IIIF files (Moreux 2019, Nakamura 2019), but no team or project has yet undertaken\
    \ a study of evidence for medieval musical performance using deep learning techniques.\
    \ \nIn this context, one of the first steps of MNEMOMED is to develop and test\
    \ one or more techniques to identify musical performances in IIIF images, and,\
    \ if possible, to analyze and annotate musical instruments in these performances\
    \ as precisely as possible. In this presentation our objective is to show an initial\
    \ experiment carried out on medieval musical iconography. \nWe first describe\
    \ the curation of a dedicated training and test corpus, based on data already\
    \ collected and annotated by domain experts for the Musiconis research programme.\
    \ Medieval musical iconography is indeed a complex area due to the variety of\
    \ cultural data involved: scenes depicting music making, performers, instruments,\
    \ dance, acrobatics, singing. Even more complex, a Musiconis image (for example\
    \ an illumination, a sculpture, or  a stained glass) generally contains several\
    \ scenes, each of which represents multiple associated instruments and performers.\
    \ It is therefore necessary to identify and separate the scenes - for most performance\
    \ one must distinguish all the musical instruments - which represents a long and\

    place in Germany under the label Coding da Vinci. The hackathon series was initiated
    by Wikimedia Germany, the Open Knowledge Foundation, the German Digital Library
    and other institutions. Since 2014, more than 60 cultural institutions provided
    open data and more than 54 creative projects have been invented. The Hackathons
    aim to encourage museums, libraries and archives to share open data. Coders, designers,
    culture fans and other volunteers work with this data. They invent and implement
    new applications that are meant to be useful, entertaining, meaningful, educational,
    or just fun. The lecturer first represented the University Library of Leipzig
    Daten as a data provider, later he organized a Coding da Vinci hackathon himself
    and finally he himself won several prizes as a participant with IIIF based apps.
    He would like to tell about his experiences with the practical use of IIIF in
    the hackathons - where IIIF was a real help and where better IIIF implementations
    would have been helpful. And finally - why don't we organize our own IIIF Hackathon
    sometime?</p><p></p>

- abstract: <p>In this lightning talk, I would like to demonstrate the inferential
    power of combining textual data and image data. </p><p>The manuscript world has
    always been interested in comparing related manuscripts. IIIF offers the promise
    of manuscript comparison. However, in many cases, this comparison leaves the end
    user underwhelmed because of the high amount of labor still required to make a
    meaningful comparison. </p><p>A digitized manuscript can contain thousands of
    images and, within this haystack, much effort is still required to find image
    segments of two parallel text passages at a level sufficiently granular to make
    comparison useful. </p><p>Attempts to target specific passages within this massive
    set of images in order to improve comparison still suffer many drawbacks. The
    manual annotation of a textual passage by drawing a box is laborious and does
    not scale. Further, this annotation provides no automatic connection to parallel
    text passages which themselves require a manual annotation and manual link between
    passages. </p><p>In many cases, the data required to facilitate these connections
    is already being created by textual scholars in the process of creating a critical
    edition. However, textual scholars are often not creating their data in ways that
    allow this data to be exploited. Conversely, when scholars do commit themselves
    to creating the required machine-accessible data, curators of historical images
    seem uninterested or unaware of how to exploit this data. More often, they seem
    interested only in providing another GUI and inviting users to manually create
    boxes for data that, in theory, already exists.</p><p>In this short demonstration,
    I will show how the automatic collection of text line coordinates, combined with
    the ongoing editorial work of textual editors (e.g. the markup of textual structure,
    division, paragraph, quotation, etc.), can be used to automatically generate image
    annotations of textual units. Further, these annotations link not only to a textual
    transcription, but to other textual image regions that contain their own parallel
    text transcriptions. Using the inferential power of linked data, I will show how
    this approach can scale to generate hundreds of thousands of useful annotations,
    that can enable real and meaningful comparisons.</p><p></p>

    \ techniques invites to skip traditional methodological approaches and to take\
    \ a look at the data from different\u2014and more experimental\u2014perspectives.\
    \ I am interested whether less methodological and more experimental approaches\
    \ can possibly help manuscript scholars in exploring their data and add new perspectives\
    \ on traditional approaches.</p><p>In my paper I\u2019ll showcase some creative\
    \ ways of applying deep neural networks, e. g. GAN, on images of medieval manuscripts.\
    \ Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are one of the more recent developments\
    \ in the field of deep neural networks. They have gained an increasing popularity\
    \ in research and art over the past year. GANs have been applied in various contexts,\
    \ and they are specialized in unsupervised learning, a field in machine learning\
    \ that still needs to mature. In theory, unsupervised learning should be able\
    \ to find previously unknown patterns in data. Therefore, experimenting with unsupervised\
    \ approaches can give interesting and surprising new insights to our research\
    \ questions. First attempts of applying GANs to medieval manuscript data have\
    \ shown, that they can be useful for the the purpose of data augmentation and\
    \ to help improving data modeling.</p><p>The second focus of the paper will be\
    \ the possibility to use pattern recognition in combination with annotations and\
    \ metadata for the purpose of clustering images according to their similarity,\
    \ their places of origin, the estimated dating, and different script types. How\
    \ can (interactive) visualizations, e. g. scatter plots or parallel coordinates,\
    \ help to explore the data. Can visualizations help to group similar scripts together\
    \ to facilitate labeling of training data? And, can visualizations assist to find\
    \ outliers, and therefore, help cleaning the data for machine learning purposes?\n\

- abstract: <p>To annotate is to add comments to an object. To audiate is to sense
    the meaning of sound when it is not present. Audio collections are not discoverable
    without annotations. If we cannot discover an audio file, we will not use it in
    scholarship. If we do not use audio collections, libraries and archives that hold
    them will not preserve them. The AudiAnnotate project, currently funded by a 2019
    Digital Extension Grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, originates
    from the premise that facilitating the annotation of audio collections will accelerate
    access to, promote scholarship on, and extend our understanding of important audio
    collections in the humanities, some of which may be currently inaccessible and
    others which could potentially be lost forever. </p><p>The application and workflows
    help users to translate their own analyses of audio recordings into media annotations
    that are publishable as easy-to-maintain, static, W3C Web Annotations associated
    with IIIF manifests and hosted and presented as static web pages in a GitHub repository
    using Jekyll. </p><p>IIIF often concerns itself with publishing resources in an
    interoperable way, but the other side of the equation is scholars using those
    resources.  AudiAnnotate bridges that gap for audio.  Audio analysis tools are
    largely offline, which makes audio-based research siloed.  By converting those
    offline analyses to web annotations that target IIIF audio resources, that research
    can be shared online.</p><p>This presentation will also discuss the technical
    architecture of AudiAnnotate, which combines tenants of minimal computing and
    IIIF, including generating a static site from a IIIF manifest & web annotations
    and creating IIIF manifests for material that has not yet been made available
    via IIIF.  </p><p></p>

- abstract: '<p>In 2019 the UCLA Library''s Software Development Team began implementation
    of a suite of services to support IIIF. These services included derivative file
    generation, manifest generation, and image delivery. The team faced many decisions
    in the design stage, including file formats (TIFF vs JP2K), image servers (Cantaloupe,
    Loris, IIP), hosting (VMWare vs AWS), conversion package (Kakadu vs OpenJPEG),
    caching (Redis/S3/Cloudfront), and more. We decided to run experiments on the
    most significant of these choices and to make data-informed decisions. In this
    presentation we will discuss our experiment setups, the metrics we targeted, and
    our results. We will also discuss the infrastructure decisions we ultimately made,
    based on our findings, and adjustments we have made since the initial implementation.

- abstract: "<p>Scalar is a content management system designed to make it easy for\
    \ authors to create born-digital scholarship. It gives authors tools to structure\
    \ essay- and book-length works in ways that leverage the unique capabilities of\
    \ digital writing, including nested, recursive, and non-linear formats. Scalar\
    \ \"enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose them with\
    \ their writing, with minimal technical expertise required\" (https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/).</p><p>Importantly,\
    \ Scalar is free and open source, and emphasizes linked open data practices. Rather\
    \ than forcing authors to download copies of media and re-upload them, Scalar\
    \ encourages importing media directly from the source (thus reusing existing media).\
    \ When using sources supported by Scalar\u2019s importer - Critical Commons, The\
    \ Internet Archive, YouTube, Vimeo, Omeka sites, and others - Scalar imports existing\
    \ metadata, allowing authors to automatically cite their resources.</p><p>This\
    \ open source, interoperable ethos is a natural fit for IIIF. Currently, Scalar\
    \ does not include any support for IIIF resources. There is some support for DZI\
    \ (Deep Zoom Image) files, which are displayed with OpenSeadragon, but users are\
    \ required to create and host the tile files themselves.</p><p>Our academic technology\
    \ team is integrating IIIF into Scalar as the cornerstone of our Scalar as a Service\
    \ rollout. We have already completed a number of other plugins (single sign on,\
    \ batch user import, etc) and have open sourced these to the Scalar community\
    \ as source PRs. We are currently developing a new media element for IIIF resources\
    \ so they can be imported into Scalar. We are also creating a Scalar media viewer\
    \ for IIIF, based on a stripped-down build of Mirador 3 (installation admins can\
    \ swap out the viewer for a custom M3 build). This work has been undertaken with\
    \ the advice and encouragement of Craig Dietrich and Erik Loyer, lead developers\
    \ for the Scalar project.</p><p>With basic IIIF support, Scalar authors can more\
    \ easily display zoomable images in the books. However, discoverability of resources\
    \ remains difficult for the entire IIIF community. Scalar has a new media import\
    \ interface called Tensor, which will eventually replace the current importer.\
    \ Tensor allows Scalar authors to search dozens of different archives and batch\
    \ import media from any of them. Developers can extend Tensor by writing new parsers\
    \ based on any search API. We are writing parsers for the Harvard Art Museum API\
    \ and Harvard\u2019s LibraryCloud API, each of which includes hundreds of thousands\
    \ of IIIF images. This import process will remove some of the barriers typically\
    \ associated with reusing IIIF resources; users will not need to know anything\
    \ about IIIF to use IIIF assets in their books. These parsers will serve as examples\
    \ for developers at other institutions who wish to make their IIIF resources more\
    \ broadly available.</p><p>With over 30,000 Scalar books hosted by on the main\
    \ (free) Alliance for Networking Visual Culture installation, these features will\
    \ quickly expose a large digital scholarship audience to IIIF.  These core features\
    \ will pave the road for future connections between Scalar and IIIF resources,\
    \ with integrated image and annotation servers good candidates for subsequent\
    \ development.\n</p>"
