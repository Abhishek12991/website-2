The IIIF Editors are pleased to announce draft revisions of the International Image Interoperability Framework Image and Presentation (formerly 'Metadata') API specifications.

 * [IIIF Image API 2.0.0-draft1](/api/image/2.0/)
 * [IIIF Presentation API 2.0.0-draft1](/api/presentation/2.0/)

These releases reflect a significant amount of input from both the IIIF working groups and the larger library, archives, and museum communities following roughly a year of experience either implementing or experimenting with the previous versions.

A complete list of the changes can be found on the IIIF website:

 * [Image API 2.0 Change Log](/api/image/2.0/change-log.html)
 * [Presentation API 2.0 Change Log](/api/presentation/2.0/change-log.html)

We welcome your feedback, questions, and use cases, and encourage you to submit feedback to the [IIIF Discussion Listserv](mailto:iiif-discuss%40googlegroups.com).
