The IIIF Consortium has partnered with the American Art Collaborative (AAC) to provide technical consulting for eight AAC museums as part of a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation. In collaboration with Sara and Ben Brumfield of [Brumfield Labs][Brumfield-Labs], and Jason Ronallo, head of Digital Library Initiatives at NCSU Libraries, the museums have received hands-on guidance and specific recommendations for implementing IIIF.

On behalf of the American Art Collaborative Rachel M. Allen said:

The collaboration has created the following outputs for the IIIF community:

 * An implementation guide from [Brumfield Labs][Brumfield-Labs] to assist Museums implementing IIIF. This is available as a PDF [acc-guide][here].
 * A questionnaire to help institutions think about the implications and practical issues with providing access to their images through IIIF. Available [acc-quest][here].
 * A two day workshop written by Jason Ronallo available as a GitBook: [http://ronallo.com/iiif-workshop/][iiif-workshop].

The collaboration in combination with community involvement will also lead to improvements in the [IIIF Quick Start Guide][quick-start].
