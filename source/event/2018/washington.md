## What is IIIF?
Embraced by a growing number of the worldâ€™s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for organizations to publish their image-based resources, to be viewed, cited, annotated and compared by any compatible image-viewing application.

## Who is it for?
