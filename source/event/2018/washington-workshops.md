# **IIIF and Scientific Images**

This would be a workshop to be held on the Monday the 21st of May to introduce the potential of including additional imaging, and scientific analytical data layers and annotations into IIIF images in Mirador. This would be for people who are new to IIIF and interested in both humanities and scientific data as it pertains to cultural heritage documents and objects. It would be a showcase of the Mirador functionality for this application, the challenges and the potential developments for other scientific data applications.

* Lead: Fenella France and Meghan Wilson <br/>
* Others: <br/>
* Duration: TBC - 9:45 - 11:00 <br/>
* Intended Audience: People who are new to Mirador and IIIF and the potential of integrated heritage scientific data to expand the static object color image, and who are interested in learning more. <br/>

An introduction to the types of scientific data that can be included as layers and annotations in IIIF compliant images. Topics include:

# **Train the trainer and IIIF Awesome**

The community has been making a more concerted effort to grow adoption of IIIF and encourage use of IIIF resources. Part of the strategy has been to offer more workshops and trainings. Now is a good time to reflect on those efforts and consider what helps people better understand IIIF and make better use of IIIF resources. This includes a discussion of IIIF Awesome which is a list of useful resources for people to find IIIF related resources.

* Lead: Jason Ronallo
* Others:
* Duration: 9:45 - 12:30 with 30 minute break.
* Intended Audience:

This session will begin with short presentations by those who have experience teaching different aspects of IIIF to various audiences. Following will be a facilitated discussion with all those in attendance with the aim of improving our understanding of how to best teach IIIF and advance our instructional goals. We will explore what still needs to be done to better promote IIIF through workshop events and training materials.

Possible questions for discussion can include:
* What approaches work best for teaching different aspects of IIIF to different audiences?
* What kinds of examples and exercises resonate with different sub-communities?
* What can we learn from the feedback we’ve received from different trainings?
* What gaps still exist in our training materials?
* How do you organize a good workshop?
* How can we include considerations of how we will teach the specifications into decisions about changes to the specs and related documentation?
* What kinds of tools, platforms, or resources do we need to allow non-technical audiences to meaningfully engage with IIIF?
* How can we promote continued learning and engagement after a workshop?
* Is there central infrastructure that could be provided by IIIF-C that would aid teaching?

Awesome:
The purpose of this working meeting would be to introduce new folks to curation of the list and invite them to join in contributing to the list’s maintenance. We will work through some open issues or pull requests to give examples of the workflow and how decisions are made for inclusion on the list. The rest of the session will be devoted to working together on other maintenance tasks like filing new issues and pull requests for new resources, adding to the lists of readings and implementations, and weeding out dead links. By the end we hope to expand the group of those who feel empowered to help maintain this important community resource.
