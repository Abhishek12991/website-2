## IIIF and its Benefits

On Tuesday, 10th of May 2016, the International Image Interoperability Framework ([IIIF][home-page]) community and the New York Museum of Modern Art ([MOMA][moma]) are hosting a one day event describing the power and potential of interoperable image delivery over the Web. Embraced by a growing number of the worldâ€™s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for organizations to publish their image-based resources, to be viewed, cited, annotated, and more by any compatible image-viewing application. The day will showcase how institutions are leveraging IIIF to reduce total cost and time to deploy image delivery solutions, while simultaneously improving end user experience with a new host of rich and dynamic features. It will also highlight how to participate in this growing movement to take advantage of the common framework.

This event will be valuable for organizational decision makers, repository and collection managers, software engineers; for cultural heritage or STEM (science / technology /  engineering / medicine) institutions; or for anyone engaged with image-based resources on the Web.  It is intended for people who have not been involved with IIIF in the past to quickly get up to speed and understand the community and its benefits. Attendance is free, and widespread dissemination of the event is encouraged. [Registration][eventbrite] is required in order to ensure that we do not exceed the capacity of the venue.

## IIIF Conference

Following the introductory event, from Wednesday 11th through Friday 13th of May, the IIIF community will hold its first annual conference in New York City and welcomes submissions for presentations, panels, lightning talks, and facilitated "birds-of-a-feather" conversations.   The first day will be a plenary single tracked event, and the following two days will be parallel tracked sessions intended for collaborative action to advance the community. Submissions relevant to all aspects of the IIIF community, the IIIF specifications, software that implements these specifications, and the provision of access to image content are solicited across all three days. Submissions related to working groups within the IIIF community are also particularly welcomed, as are demonstrations of IIIF being used in novel and interesting ways. 

Submissions should be sent to [iiif-proposals@googlegroups.com][proposals] as PDF extended abstracts, of at most 2 pages in length, outlining the following:

* Title of Presentation
* Presentation type: 
  * Lightning Talk: 5-10 minute presentation
  * Talk/Demo: 20 minute presentation, including time for questions
  * Panel: 60 minute session with three or more discussants on a topic of interest
  * Conversation: A one hour or more facilitated discussion amongst attendees
  * Working Session: A two hour, and likely more, session to make progress on API or Implementation topics to be described 
* Who will present or lead the session
* A description of the topic; visuals such as diagrams or screenshots are appreciated
* Why it is of interest to the broader community 
* How many people are anticipated to attend the session
* Whether you would like it considered for the IIIF and its Benefits event at MOMA

Submissions will be accepted up until March 21st, 2016 and no extensions to this date are expected.  They will be reviewed by a program committee consisting of members from the IIIF Editorial Board and the Coordinating Committee. An announcement as to the accepted presentations will be made in the week of March 28th, and a schedule available shortly thereafter.
