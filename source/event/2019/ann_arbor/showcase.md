...then we would love to have you join us at the IIIF Showcase. All are welcome!

Come join us for a day-long free event that will educate, inspire, and reinvent your technical infrastructure. **The event is free, but space is limited. Please register early to guarantee yourself a spot!** All event proceedings will be in English unless otherwise noted.

### Who is it for?

The IIIF Showcase is an event for people new to IIIF to get an overview and discover the latest developments in a single event (though it offers something for everyone, so returning attendees are welcome as well!). It assumes no previous experience with IIIF and will cover the full gamut of IIIF from the basics to Showcases of the latest developments in the IIIF Community.
