# Events

We hear a lot that attending a IIIF event is the best “first bite” to get involved. One conference attendee told us:

> “The technical stuff is hard. It’s dealing with a hard thing. It’s modeling something that’s complex. It’s going to be tricky to get to grips with. The thing that made the difference was attending my first IIIF conference.”

We normally have an annual conference in either the US or EU/UK and there are regional events too. The various [community groups](https://iiif.io/community/groups/) gather much more regularly to talk and figure out what needs doing, and support regional events. Even if you’re not yet using IIIF, you’re very welcome to join any of our events. You’re welcome to [host your own event](https://iiif.io/event/conference_guidelines/).
