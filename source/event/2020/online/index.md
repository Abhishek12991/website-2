## Sessions

### Opening Panel: The Changing Meaning of Access in Digital Collections

**June 1, 11amET**

**Description:** This panel will focus on the strategies developed and deployed by high-profile IIIF-implementing institutions. Digital Strategy has always been a moving target, necessarily taking into account impact models and institution-specific theories of change while also incorporating evolving user needs and accounting for iterating new technologies. In light of a global pandemic that has perhaps permanently altered common paths of inquiry -- from academic scholarship to the satisfaction of curiosity -- these strategies are liable to change further, in ways both predictable and not. Join us for a conversation with leaders from three world-class institutions as they meld innovative and responsive digital strategy with unique culture and legacy.

**Intended Audience:** All are welcome! This session is intended for anyone working in or with cultural heritage institutions, no experience with IIIF required.

*Link to recording will be included here following the presentation*

### Introduction to IIIF 
**June 1, 2pmET**
**June 2, 4amET**

**Description:** This session will cover the basics of IIIF technology and the IIIF Community, as well as a number of core use cases from among the hundreds of implementers of IIIF. Currently, there are four IIIF specifications for flexible image delivery, presentation, authentication, and search-within functionality. 

**Intended audience:** Beginner level -- Maybe you've heard about IIIF before, but want to know about the details and how IIIF might work for you and/or your institution. Or maybe you already know a bit, but you want more info on how to connect with the IIIF Community.

*Link to recording will be included here following the presentation*


### Fun with IIIF
**June 5, 11amET**

**Description:** Most of the uses of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) have rightly focused on scholarly and research applications. In this lightning talk, however, I plan to look at the opposite extreme: the state of the art for creating playful and fun applications of the IIIF APIs. From tile puzzles, to arcade games, via terapixel fractals, virtual galleries, 3D environments, a voice-activated Bladerunner-style viewer and more. Time to bring frivolity back to GLAM content. 

**Intended audience:** Beginner and above -- Knowing what IIIF can do and how to work with IIIF resources will be helpful background, but the examples in this presentation stand on their own and will be of interest regardless of familiarity with IIIF.
