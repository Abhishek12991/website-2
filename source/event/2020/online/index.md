## Sessions

### Opening Panel: The Changing Meaning of Access in Digital Collections

**June 1, 11amET**

This panel will focus on the strategies developed and deployed by high-profile IIIF-implementing institutions. Digital Strategy has always been a moving target, necessarily taking into account impact models and institution-specific theories of change while also incorporating evolving user needs and accounting for iterating new technologies. In light of a global pandemic that has perhaps permanently altered common paths of inquiry -- from academic scholarship to the satisfaction of curiosity -- these strategies are liable to change further, in ways both predictable and not. Join us for a conversation with leaders from three world-class institutions as they meld innovative and responsive digital strategy with unique culture and legacy.
