IIIF Week Online is a series of **free** online events introducing IIIF’s capabilities and community, sharing demonstrations of IIIF implementations, and discussing the future of IIIF, digital strategy for cultural heritage, and digital research needs. 

While we are saddened by the need to postpone our annual conference, previously scheduled to take place the same week, we recognize this is an opportunity for many to attend who otherwise would not have been able due to budgets, travel restrictions, and other obligations. We look forward to bringing together a wider group of the IIIF community during this virtual event.

IIIF Week sessions are developed for both newcomers and experienced implementers, and include specially scheduled times to allow attendees to form regional community connections in the US, Europe, and Asia. **You may sign up for all events during the week, or just the ones that interest you.**

All event proceedings will be in English unless otherwise indicated, and all sessions will be recorded and made available following the conference.

Interested attendees may also sign up for a workshop on getting started with IIIF the week following the conference. X amount of experience required. Register here: &lt;link>

## Sessions

The sessions below are listed in chronological order.

<!-- ### Monday, June 1 -->


### Opening Panel: Responding to Current Events with Digital Collections Strategy

<h4 class="session_time" duration="60" start="2020-06-01 11:00">11:00 AM - 12:00 PM ET</h4>

[**Register**](https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/3815882610041/WN_Ja6n10uNTKeyKVI_kix3mQ)

**Presenters**:
* Emmanuel Bermès, Deputy Director for Services and Networks at BnF
* Christy Henshaw, Digital Production Manager at Wellcome Collection
* Kate Zwaard, Director of Digital Strategy at the Library of Congress

**Description**: This panel will focus on the strategies developed and deployed by major IIIF-implementing institutions. Digital Strategy has always been a moving target, necessarily taking into account impact models and institution-specific theories of change while also incorporating evolving user needs and accounting for iterating new technologies. In light of a global pandemic that has perhaps permanently altered common paths of inquiry – from academic scholarship to the satisfaction of curiosity – these strategies are liable to change further, in ways both predictable and not. Join us for a conversation with leaders from three world-class institutions as they meld innovative and responsive digital strategy with unique culture and legacy. **Intended audience**: All are welcome! Anyone interested in the path forward for libraries, museums, archives, and other institutions working to present digitized materials to meet a broad set of demands. No experience with IIIF required.

### Fun with IIIF

<h4 class="session_time" duration="60" start="2020-06-05 11:00">11:00 AM - 12:00 PM ET</h4>

[**Register**](https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/5415882763352/WN_F8Yrs1CZTxGPBHfVjh81kw)

**Description:** Most of the uses of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) have rightly focused on scholarly and research applications. This session, however, will look at the opposite extreme: the state of the art for creating playful and fun applications of the IIIF APIs. From tile puzzles, to arcade games, via terapixel fractals, virtual galleries, 3D environments, a voice-activated Bladerunner-style viewer and more. Time to bring frivolity back to GLAM content. **Intended audience:** Beginner and above -- Knowing what IIIF can do and how to work with IIIF resources will be helpful background, but the examples in this presentation stand on their own and will be of interest regardless of familiarity with IIIF.

## IIIF Hands on workshop
**June 8th to June 12th**

The week following the online conference there will be a chance to get hands on experience with IIIF and learn the skills to get started. This will be an online course and places will be limited. It will involve daily zoom presentations from tutors, and drop-in help session following the online tutorial. The course will cover:

 * Getting started with the Image API 
 * Creating IIIF Manifests with the Bodleian manifest editor 
 * Annotating IIIF resources and setting up an annotation server
 * Introduction to various IIIF tools for scholarship 

Participants will need a laptop on which they can install software and should be able to commit a few per day for the week long course in order to get the most out of it.
