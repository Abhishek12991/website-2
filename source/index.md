<p class="lookatme">IIIF is a software system delivering high quality, attributed digital objects* online at large scale. IIIF is _also_ the growing international community of people who improve it.</p>

<small> A digital object could be a scroll, a map, an incunabulum, a newspaper, a photograph, a book, a score, a 3D model... We think there’s even a quilt in there somewhere.</small>


## Great for researchers

Researchers need to be able to **access** high quality images, **examine** them closely, and **share** their work with collaborators. IIIF helps this work by providing easy access to large images from multiple repositories and viewing and manipulation tools to aid research. Here’s a demo of one of the more popular IIIF Image Viewers, called Mirador. Have a try:

## Efficient for developers

Publish once, use often! A developer’s dream, IIIF allows you to set your images to stun! When you adopt the framework, you can serve all your digital objects to anyone who speaks IIIF anywhere in the world. There’s a thriving tight community of folks around the world contributing to the growing toolset too.

## Satisfying for leaders

We’re all in this game because we want to share knowledge and collections as widely as possible. If we can do it cost-effectively, we’re doing good work. IIIF is being adopted the world over by world-leading institutions, and serving billions of digital objects online without vendor lock-in and with strong open-source and community-driven ethics. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Join the IIIF consortium today</span>** as publishers of your collection objects, code contributors, or voting members.
