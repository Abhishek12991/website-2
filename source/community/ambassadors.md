# Ambassadors

The ambassador program deputizes community members to take a more formal role in championing IIIF adoption in their communities. Ambassadors focus their efforts around different domains, associations, tools, or regions and meet with IIIF-C staff periodically to provide updates and feedback.

The program is currently in trial, with our first group appointed by invite from the Outreach group and IIIF-C staff. Following a successful trial period, those interested in becoming an Ambassador may apply during an annual call.
