# COMMUNITY

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Code of Conduct</span> | <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Community Groups</span> | <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ambassadors</span> | <span style="text-decoration:underline;">About the IIIF Consortium</span>

Scholars, software people, researchers, and culture workers are the types who tend to gravitate around IIIF, and everything we do is guided by our **[code of conduct]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/event/conduct/)**.

There are four main ways to join the conversation:



1. Sign up for the **[newsletter](https://iiif.io/newsletter/#newsletter-signup)** - news about events, training, cool projects, and community updates
2. Jump on one of the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">community calls</span>** - friendly, regular calls with interested folk, from beginners to experts
3. Subscribe to the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">iiif-discuss mailing list</span>** - more technical, Q&A, project-related
4. Join the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">IIIF Slack</span>** team - lots of activity, specific channels for groups, and more!

There are **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">groups</span>** to discuss various elements or contexts of IIIF usage or to agree on direction (or not!) of a particular idea or initiative. Some things in IIIF require slightly more formal governance, which happens through five **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">committees</span>**. For example, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technical Review Committee</span> is the committee responsible for the IIIF APIs.
