# Introduction

This document records scheduled changes that are intended to be made in the future, but must wait for new major releases as they're backwards incompatible.

# Image API

* Require support for the `square` region at compliance level 1.
* Clarify that height and width are for calculating aspect ratio only, as there is no 'source' image.

# Presentation API

* Require a URI for non sc:painting Annotations
* Update Annotation and AnnotationList model to use the Web Annotation specifications
