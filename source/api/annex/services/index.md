## Abstract
{:.no_toc}
This document describes the set of related services that have been identified within the IIIF as useful to reference from within the IIIF APIs.  This primarily relates to the [Presentation API][prezi-api] but may be of use beyond that.

## 1. Introduction

There are many desirable features that could be usefully included in resource descriptions beyond those already defined in the [Presentation API][prezi-api].  However, in order to keep the API manageable and lean enough to be understood, implemented and validated, any feature which is not able to be justified as universally applicable will be imported as a service from an external resource.  The adoption of [JSON-LD][json-ld] is paramount in this respect, as it gives a solid basis for interoperability and disambiguation between systems.

## 2. Requirements

Services _SHOULD_ be valid [JSON-LD][json-ld], and if so _MUST_ have their own `@context` supplied in the Presentation API response.  Services _SHOULD_ have an `@id` that can be dereferenced, and if so, the representation retrieved _SHOULD_ be JSON-LD.

Services _MAY_ be included either by reference or embedded within the Presentation API documents if appropriate.  The decision as to whether to embed or reference is left up to the implementer, however embedded descriptions should be kept as short as possible.  If the only properties of the object are `@context` and `@id`, then the client _SHOULD_ retrieve the resource from the URI given in `@id`.

Services _SHOULD_ have a `profile` URI which can be used to determine the type of service.  The representation of the URI _SHOULD_ be a human or machine readable description of the service.

  "service": {
    "@context": "http://example.org/ns/jsonld/context.json",
    "@id": "http://example.org/service/example.json",
    "profile": "http://example.org/docs/example-service.html"
    // Additional keys may be embedded here, if not, the @id should be retrieved 
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Recognized Services

### 3.1 Image Information

The main usage of services is to provide a reference from the [Presentation API][prezi-api] to the content to be displayed via the [Image API][image-api].  The JSON-LD content to be referenced or embedded is the Image Information document, also known as `info.json`.  The URI to be given in `@id` is the base URI of the Image API service.
