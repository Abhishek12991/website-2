# Demos

![IIIF examples]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/demos.png "IIIF demos")


It’s usually better to try a few working examples when you’re trying to get your head around a new technology, so we’ve gathered some demos for you that cover the two key areas of the way IIIF works: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Image Viewers</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Image Servers</span>.  We’ve included some demos built by the community that are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just for fun</span>, too!

You should definitely check out the [Awesome IIIF page on Github](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif). That’s a community-driven compendium of all things IIIF, and there’s a ton of stuff to explore.
