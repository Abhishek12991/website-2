# Online Training


Following the success of the online workshop in June we are offering the opportunity to take part in another edition of this course. Participants will follow the [online workshop materials](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/) including watching videos on the Image, Presentation APIs and using annotations with IIIF.  

Support will be given by the IIIF Technical Coordinator in the form of a group slack channel, daily group check-in sessions and 1 to 1 meetings. Participants will be encouraged to bring their own images to the workshop and work on a project during the week putting in to practice what they are learning and these will be demoed to other participants on the last day of the workshop.

The course will cover:

*   Getting started with the Image API
*   Creating IIIF Manifests with the Bodleian manifest editor
*   Annotating IIIF resources and setting up an annotation server
*   Introduction to various IIIF tools and techniques for scholarship

No prior knowledge of IIIF is required and the core sessions should be easily accessible to those with confidence using the Web.

Participants will need a laptop on which they can install software and should be able to commit to a minimum of 3-4 hours per day for the 5 day course. They will need to install Zoom, [ Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) and various workshop specific tools.

As well as the core sessions listed above there are a number of guest presentations that were recorded during the first online workshop available in the [Workshop notes](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/GuestPresentations.html). If participants are interested in hearing about other tools we will try and source extra Guest presentations during the week. These sessions will be recorded for later viewing by participants that can’t make these extra calls.
