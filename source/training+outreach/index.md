## Training offerings



Following the success of the online workshop in June we are offering the opportunity to take part in a recurring edition of this course. Participants will follow the [online workshop materials](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/) including watching videos on the Image, Presentation APIs and using annotations with IIIF.  See our [Online Training page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training+outreach/online_training) for details.
