## Training offerings

### LYRASIS partnership

IIIF and [LYRASIS](https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/LYRASIS-Learning.aspx) are working together to create online training on IIIF. Two sessions are currently scheduled:

- [IIIFâ€™s Tools for teaching with image-based primary sources](https://www.lyrasis.org/Content/Pages/Event-Details.aspx?Eid=F9077FDE-4DAA-EA11-80EB-00155DE5EC03) (August 5th, 3:00 pm ET)
- [Introduction to IIIF](https://www.lyrasis.org/Content/Pages/Event-Details.aspx?Eid=F26BCB02-CACA-EA11-80EB-00155DE5EC03) (October 8th, 11:00 am ET)

New classes will be added to the [LYRASIS online class schedule](https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/LYRASIS-Learning.aspx) in the coming months.

### Online training

Following the success of the online workshop in June we are offering the opportunity to take part in a recurring edition of this course. Participants will follow the [online workshop materials](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/) including watching videos on the Image, Presentation APIs and using annotations with IIIF.  See our [Online Training page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training+outreach/online_training) for details.
