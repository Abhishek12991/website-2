Questions to address at some point:

- How is https://iiif.io/sitemap.xml generated?
- How should we handle event data? data.events.csv
  - Also, how to differentiate past events from future events?
- Search for "text-decoration:underline" and make sure we've caught them all and replaced them with proper links
- Figure out a proper way to handle acronyms.md issue? Without duplicating in every page
- Index page: switch Mirador viewer into 3 side-by-side images rather than stacked; default dark mode to balance UV below; is there any way to make this narrower so it remains in line w/ span of text?
